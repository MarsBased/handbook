# Holidays, time off & paid leaves

## Local holidays

We're a remote working company, and the team is spread throughout different cities and countries.

Team members are asked to choose the local holidays that best suit them: Barcelona, Valencia, Avilés, Coimbra, etc. At the beginning of the year, we set up the official holiday calendar for each team member.

Feel free to exchange any local holidays for another normal day, any time.

Use the [2025 Time Off](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kX1bUUjUc9MJWNqbx4z5NvWUsieUL0znwmiw2MVATIo/edit?usp=sharing) Google Sheet to review your local holidays and days off, and to check your teammates' schedules.

> Bookmark this Google Sheet for easy access, as you will have to access it often.

## How to request days off?

We officially have 24 working days per year to take off apart from the local holidays mentioned above.

To request new holidays, open the [2025 Time Off](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kX1bUUjUc9MJWNqbx4z5NvWUsieUL0znwmiw2MVATIo/edit?usp=sharing) Google Sheet, go to the tab/sheet named after you, and simply add a comment in the vacations column. Elisabet will be automatically notified and will review the requests and approve them, adding another comment, and notifying you back.

> [!TIP]
> To request multiple days off, add a comment to the first day's request, specifying all the days you need.

Kindly bear in mind:

* Let us know well in advance if you are taking:
  * 1-2 days off, let us know at least 2 weeks in advance.
  * 3 or more days off, we will ask you to give us one month of notice.
  * More than 1 week off, let us know two months in advance.
  * You can save up to five vacation days to use in the following year. The remaining days must be taken within the current calendar year.
* Please check the viability of the project you are working on before requesting your holidays.

## Medical leaves

If you feel sick 🤒 and need to go to the doctor 👩🏻‍⚕️, there is no need for you to compensate for those hours later on. Just let us know on this [Linear issue](https://linear.app/marsbased/issue/MBT-17), take a good rest and get well soon! You don't need to worry about your sick leave affecting your payroll. MarsBased will be covering your full salary also during the first four days of leave (a period in which the company is exempt from paying the salary to the employee according to Spanish regulations).

If you are sick for more than two days, we kindly ask you to send us your doctor's medical sick leave document so that we can notify the Health Authority and comply with the legal requirements. If you are sick for 1-2 days, there is no need for you to send us that document.

## Health appointment

If you have a regular appointment at the doctor or the dentist, or you need to accompany a relative to the doctor within your ordinary working schedule, you are free to organize yourself as best fits you to recover those hours. You don't need to send us any proof of your doctor's visit.

If for some reason you have to visit the doctor on a regular basis due to treatment or whatsoever, let Leire Oiarbide know and she’ll be happy to help you find the best way to reconcile both.

## Parental leave

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Congratulations to the soon-to-be parents! 👶🏻

Let us know if you’re expecting a baby and we’ll try to support you as much as possible in that big adventure.

These are the general terms, which are discussed to best adapt to the needs in each case:

* __Pregnancy controls:__ Take the time you need for the regular pregnancy controls, either you are pregnant or need to accompany your partner. There is no need for you to recover that time afterward.
* __Parental leave:__ When the baby is born, the general parental leave is 16 weeks according to the current Spanish regulations. You decide if you want to take those weeks in a row or distribute them, but at least 6 weeks must be after the birth according to the law.
* __Breastfeeding permit:__ Once you’re back from parental leave, you’ll be eligible for the breastfeeding permit until the baby is 9 months old. You can either accumulate the hours and enjoy them at once as an extension of the parental leave, or have your work schedule reduced by 1 hour per day.
