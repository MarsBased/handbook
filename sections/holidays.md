# Holidays, Time off & Sick leave

## Local holidays

Being most of the team members based in Barcelona, we normally take Barcelona’s local holidays as our official calendar. However, team members living in other locations, are asked to choose the local holidays that best suit them. This way, at the beginning of the year we set up the official holiday calendar for each team member.

But feel free to exchange any local holidays for another normal day, any time. Flexibility, remember.


## Vacations

We officially have 24 working days per year to take off apart from the official holidays marked in the company calendar. If for some reason one year you don’t enjoy all the available days off, you can enjoy them next year and the other way around. If you need some additional days, feel free to let us know!

Make sure to request your holidays with enough time so we can coordinate accordingly! If you are taking 1-2 days, let us know at least 2 weeks in advance. If you are taking three or more days, we will ask you to give us one month of notice. If you are taking more than one week, let us know two months in advance. Before requesting your holidays, we kindly ask you to check the viability with the project you are working for, and let us know if there is any important deadline we should know in order to assign some other team member to the project if that’s needed. We’ll do our best so that you can enjoy those days! 

We have a thread for requesting holidays on Basecamp. Leire will add that to Harvest-Forecast so we can all be on the same page, but make sure it's right if you're so kind!


## Time off

Everybody needs to be at home when the repairman/plumber/DSL technician/etc comes and might be easily distracted.

Sometimes our most loved ones need to be taken care of.

You might want to take a train to go for a long weekend on Friday but will be splitting the day into two.

There are a million reasons why we have flexible schedules. Just drop us a line like “hey guys, Wednesday morning I might be off for three hours, I will catch up later” and that’s fine. A message on Slack on the #status channel will do.


## Sick leave

Same for sick leave. Just let us know and rest a lot. We wish we could help you more with that.

If you feel sick and need to go to the doctor, there is no need that you compensate those hours later on. As we said, take rest and get on well soon! You don't need to worry about your sick leave affecting on your payroll. MarsBased will be covering your full salary also during the first 4 days of leave (period in which the company is exempt from paying the salary to the employee according to Spanish regulations). 

If you are sick for more than 2 days, we'll kindly ask you to send us your doctor's medical sick leave document so that we can notify the Health Authority and comply with the legal requirements. 


## Health appointment

If you have a regular appointment at the doctor, the dentist, or you need to accompany a relative to the doctor within your ordinary working schedule, you are free to organize yourself as best fits you to recover those hours. You don't need to send us any proof of your doctor's visit.

If for some reason you have to visit the doctor on a regular basis due to a treatment or whatsoever, let Leire know and she’ll be happy to help you find the best way to reconcile both.
