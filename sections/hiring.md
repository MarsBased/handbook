# Hiring

We grow organically by hiring 2-3 people every year. For the first five years of the company, we only hired very senior profiles, but we've loosened up a bit now to accommodate all kinds of different projects.

We are currently hiring, to increase our Ruby team and also a JS Tech Lead, but for a more up-to-date, check the <a href="https://marsbased.com/jobs" title="MarsBased jobs" target="_blank">Jobs section</a> on our website.

# Referrals

As a small company, we can’t do everything. We’ve tried outsourcing part of the hiring, but the truth is that it hasn’t worked well. Hiring agencies haven’t proved very useful to us. Job boards, on the contrary, work pretty well.

However, internal referrals work well, too.

This company is based on the foundations of a good and strong relationship between employees, and in some cases, these relationships come from before. 

Our first employee (Javier Pérez), David Gómez and Àlex (CEO) used to work together in VASS. Jordi, Xavi, Juan and Javier worked together in GreenData. Pablo and David Garmendia coincided in a company in Asturias. Oriol, we met him in the early days of MarsBased when he was running his company, Dineyo. One of our long-term freelancers, Pablo, we met him at the Startup Grind Barcelona events.

If you want to work again with someone you like, be it a friend or simply someone you respect and admire, we can give it a try. If you introduce us to this person and facilitate the conversations, you will get a referral bonus of 1000€ if we end up hiring her or him.

We will pay the bonus after the third month of that person in the company.
