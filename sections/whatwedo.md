# What we do

MarsBased is a consultancy of expert developers in Ruby on Rails, Node.js, React and Angular boosting companies using technology and agile methodologies.

We started off in early 2014 as a web-only development shop using Rails and Angular because our founders Jordi and Xavi had been using these technologies in their previous companies. Over the years, we've expanded our technological horizons slightly.

## Technologies & services

As a consultancy, we deal with many different clients, from all countries and all sectors. We've worked with clients from San Francisco to Singapore, from Germany to the Basque Country. As for the sectors, we've worked in fintech, we've built marketplaces, we've developed smart cities platforms, we've refactored other people's codes, we've done code audits and built dozens of web and mobile apps.

You can find a description of the technologies we use in the services pages of our website:

* __[Ruby on Rails](https://marsbased.com/services/ruby-on-rails)__
*  __[Node.js](https://marsbased.com/services/node)__
*  __[React](https://marsbased.com/services/react)__
*  __[Angular](https://marsbased.com/services/Angular)__
*  __[Shopify](https://marsbased.com/services/Ecommerce)__

The aforementioned technologies are used mostly for the web, but we also do mobile apps, just not so often. In this case, we use Ionic or React Native, but we never do native mobile development. We also do lots of e-commerce with Shopify and install and develop on the Consul/Decidim platform.

In 2019, we started to offer a new service: [tech due diligences](https://marsbased.com/services/techaudits/). A lot of VCs and M&A companies don't have the competencies, the personnel or the bandwidth to assess the status and integrity of the technology of the companies they want to invest in or acquire.

We help them to audit several aspects of the technology of these companies like the infrastructure, the choice of programming languages and frameworks, scalability, security issues, code quality and much more.

## Community

We spend a considerable amount of time and resources to develop community around us. Helping both the tech and startups communities in Barcelona, we have become one of the most active companies in the ecosystem.
