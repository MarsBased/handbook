# Who is who

Our team primarily consists of software engineers and experts in web/mobile development, designers, project managers and tech leads, but other roles are also needed for the spaceship to fly.

## CEO

Àlex is our CEO and co-founder. He is responsible for finding deals and bringing them to the quoting stage. Then, more technical team members will create the estimate and quote document so Àlex can send it and follow up to close the deal.

We're purely an inbound company. This means that companies find us, not the other way around. We need to make it easier for them to find us. Àlex is also responsible for the company's marketing. In addition to maintaining the website and writing the blog, he is in charge of running our podcast <a href="https://podcast.marsbased.com/" title="Life on Mars - the MarsBased podcast" target="_blank">Life on Mars</a>, our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MarsBased" title="MarsBased - YouTube channel" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>, and our social media profiles, as well as our participation in technology and entrepreneurship events like Startup Grind.

## CTO

Xavi, our CTO and co-founder, has over 15 years of experience developing applications. As a seasoned CTO and technical architect, he oversees all the company's projects, supports our tech leads, writes the technical slides of our project proposals, and makes the most complex technical decisions.

Over the years, Xavi has determined our company's tech stack, incorporating technologies such as Node.js, React, Angular, Ruby on Rails, Python, and AI more recently.

## COO

Jordi, the third co-founder, oversees operations, finances, design, project management, and presales. He takes the requirements for new projects, writes most project proposals, provides estimates, supervises the company's finances, and organizes the project management duties and all the design work.

Jordi plays a key role in defining the company's processes, tools, and platforms.

## Head of People

Leire/Eli, as our Head of People, sits in the middle of our non-existent office and is the real catalyser of everything that happens in the company. She makes everyone's days better and of MarsBased a great place to work in.

For any questions regarding logistics or ways to improve your workday, Leire/Eli is the person to ask. This includes information about the benefits and perks available to MarsBased employees and much more.

Leire/Eli also oversees the organization of our public and internal events, such as the Martian Days and company retreats. Additionally, she contributes to our marketing efforts, including the MarsBased newsletter and our YouTube channel.

Leire/Eli is the go-to person for any personal issues, sick leave requests, work schedule changes, or holiday requests.

## Tech Leads

Tech Leads play a crucial role in complementing Project Managers and ensuring technical excellence. Their responsibilities include:

- **Owning project delivery**, taking full responsibility for ensuring everything functions as expected.
- **Reviewing developed tasks promptly**, particularly those marked as “In Review”, when there are no other roles being able to review them.
- **Thoughtfully define tasks from a technical standpoint** based on the team's needs and project requirements.
- **Proactively sharing project status** updates to keep all stakeholders informed.
- **Prioritizing and delivering** even under tight deadlines.

## Engineering Managers

Engineering Managers at MarsBased share many responsibilities with Tech Leads but focus more on supporting the entire technical team’s growth and operational excellence. In addition to managing technical projects like Tech Leads, their key duties include:

- **Maintaining high standards of technical delivery**, by mentoring, guiding, and reviewing team outputs.
- **Leading by example**, balancing hands-on technical problem-solving with strategic oversight.
- **Driving internal initiatives and technical resources**, by leading internal projects such as the creation and maintenance of security guides, coding guides, and project templates.
- **Overseeing the elaboration and application of technical guides**, ensuring that best practices and company standards are not only documented but actively applied across all teams.
- **Maintaining deep technical expertise**, possessing a level of knowledge about MarsBased technologies and infrastructure that is on par with the CTO, enabling them to make informed decisions and provide high-level guidance.

## Engineers

Software engineers at MarsBased are at the core of our delivery. We value not only their ability to write code but also how they contribute to the success of the team, the project, and ultimately, our clients' businesses. Our software engineers are expected to be self-driven, pragmatic, and collaborative, always striving for excellence in everything they do.

We believe in a balanced approach that values **communication, accountability, agility, and craftsmanship**.

Communication is the most critical aspect of our software engineers' day-to-day work. Our fully remote nature means that clear, frequent, and proactive communication is not optional — it is what keeps the spaceship flying.

We expect software engineers to own the quality of what they build. They are the first line of defense against defects, misunderstandings, and technical debt.

At MarsBased, we value speed, but not at the cost of quality. We believe in thoughtful execution that avoids unnecessary complexity.

We take pride in our craft. Code at MarsBased should reflect clarity, simplicity, and respect for those who will maintain it after you.

Above all, we expect software engineers to take ownership of their work. This means seeing beyond the immediate task, understanding the "why" behind what we build, and contributing to the success of the entire team. We don't just ship code — we ship solutions that help our clients succeed.

The crew coding our way through the galaxy: David, Jose Luis, José, Laura, Alejandro, Mateo, Enrique, Marta, Juan Pablo, Víctor, and Anna.
