# Who is who

Our team primarily consists of engineers and experts in web/mobile development, designers, project managers and tech leads, but other roles are also needed for the spaceship to fly.

## CEO

Àlex is our CEO and co-founder. He is responsible for finding deals and bringing them to the quoting stage. Then, more technical team members will create the estimate and quote document so Àlex can send it and follow up to close the deal.

We're purely an inbound company. This means that companies find us, not the other way around. We need to make it easier for them to find us. Àlex is also responsible for the company's marketing. In addition to maintaining the website and writing the blog, he is in charge of running our podcast <a href="https://podcast.marsbased.com/" title="Life on Mars - the MarsBased podcast" target="_blank">Life on Mars</a>, our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MarsBased" title="MarsBased - YouTube channel" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>, and our social media profiles, as well as our participation in technology and entrepreneurship events like Startup Grind.

## CTO

Xavi, our CTO and co-founder, has over 15 years of experience developing applications. As a seasoned CTO and technical architect, he oversees all the company's projects, supports our tech leads, writes the technical slides of our project proposals, and makes the most complex technical decisions.

Over the years, Xavi has determined our company's tech stack, incorporating technologies such as Node.js, React, Angular, Ruby on Rails, Python, and AI more recently.

## COO

Jordi, the third co-founder, oversees operations, finances, design, project management, and presales. He takes the requirements for new projects, writes most project proposals, provides estimates, supervises the company's finances, and organizes the project management duties and all the design work.

Jordi plays a key role in defining the company's processes, tools, and platforms.

## Head of People

Leire/Eli, as our Head of People, sits in the middle of our non-existent office and is the real catalyser of everything that happens in the company. She makes everyone's days better and of MarsBased a great place to work in.

For any questions regarding logistics or ways to improve your workday, Leire/Eli is the person to ask. This includes information about the benefits and perks available to MarsBased employees and much more.

Leire/Eli also oversees the organization of our public and internal events, such as the Martian Days and company retreats. Additionally, she contributes to our marketing efforts, including the MarsBased newsletter and our YouTube channel.

Leire/Eli is the go-to person for any personal issues, sick leave requests, work schedule changes, or holiday requests.
