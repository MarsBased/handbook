# Requesting Holidays & Materials

## Sick leave and time off

Everybody needs to go to the doctor. 

Everybody needs to be at home when the repairman/plumber/DSL technician/etc comes and might be easily distracted.

Sometimes our most loved ones need to be taken care of.

You might want to take a train to go for a long weekend on Friday but will be splitting the day into two.

There are a million reasons why we have flexible schedules. Just drop us a line like “hey guys, Wednesday morning I might be off for three hours, I will catch up later” and that’s fine. A message on Slack on the #status channel will do.

Same for sick leave. Just let us know and rest a lot. We wish we could help you more with that.

The same applies to the holidays and vacation: want to take a day off? do it. “Hey guys, on the 21st I won’t be in town. Don’t contact me”. You know when you can take some time off and how to manage your time. You just need to coordinate with your team with sufficient notice - a couple of weeks at least - (on Basecamp) and that'll do.

We officially have 23 working days per year to take off apart from the official holidays marked in the company calendar. If for some reason one year you don’t enjoy all the available days off, you can enjoy them next year and the other way around. If you need some additional days, feel free to let us know!

If you need extra days, make sure to request it with enough time so we can coordinate accordingly!

We have a thread for that on Basecamp. You should let us know with at least a month of notice. Leire will add that to Harvest so we can all be on the same page, but make sure it's right if you're so kind!

## Local holidays

Being most of the team members based in Barcelona, we normally take Barcelona’s local holidays as our official calendar. However, team members living in other locations, are asked to choose the local holidays that best suit them. This way, at the beginning of the year we set up the official holiday calendar for each team member.

But feel free to exchange any local holidays for another normal day, any time. Flexibility, remember.

## Requesting office material & other stuff

Count on our support with the materials you need to create or improve your working conditions. This includes the devices that make your work life easier, such as a trackpad, keyboard, etc., as well as the adequation of the workplace itself. 
 
Those of you working from home may need a chair, a desk or an external monitor.
 
Those of you that need a coworking space (because you don’t have the adequate working conditions at home or for some reason you work better from there), will get an allowance of 150 euro per month for paying the cost. 
 
Contact Leire to request office material and other stuff you might need. She's the catalyser of everything in the company.

We don't need a complicated process for this, do we?
