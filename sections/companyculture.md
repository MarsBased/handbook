# Company culture

We live by a very distinct and solid set of values guiding us in our day to day. Our Company Culture has been fundamental to hiring and growing the company.

Company Culture is what happens when the founders are not in the room. It's a set of tools that will help you to act and decide better according to our values.

You can read (almost) everything we know about company culture in these four blog posts:

These are the pillars of our company culture:

* __Remote first__: Our company is 100% remote. We have no office and our team is completely distributed. As such, we devise all our workflows and projects to adapt to our remoteness and every decision we take should not compromise this policy and mindset.
* __Transparency__: We believe in openness as a way to provide more honesty and trust to our clients and among our team. A good and fluid communication based on transparency will help to spot issues before they appear or will eliminate them altogether.
* __Always exceed expectations__: We believe in specialisation and on going the extra mile for everything we do. We're not only really good developers, but our delivery is also excellent.
* __Less is more__: We believe that less is more and that simplicity is beautiful. In the event of having to choose between quality and quantity, we will always err on the side of quality and we will never take rushed-up decisions or actions compromising our principles.
* __Community-oriented__: We contribute heavily to the startups & tech communities in Barcelona. We mentor new developers, work on open source and organise and sponsor events all year round to help the new generations of startups & tech people in our ecosystem!
