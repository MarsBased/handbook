## Travel Booking Process

### How to Book Travel? 

Here’s how it works:

* Get approval from your manager.
* Please contact the People team as early as possible. They will handle the booking for you. Send your request to administration@marsbased.com.

### Expense Categories

When planning our trips, we aim to keep things efficient and budget-friendly while meeting our needs. The earlier we plan, the better the options and savings.

#### Flights ✈️

* We travel in Economy Class.
* Changes and cancellations will only be made in exceptional cases with a justified reason.

#### Accommodation 🛏

* We usually book double rooms for a single use for extra comfort.
* Additional reimbursable accommodation costs include: Wi-Fi fees, parking fees, and breakfast charges (if not included in the room rate).

#### Ground Transportation 🚆 🚘 🚖

* Trains, subways, and buses are our go-to for getting around.
* Taxis are ok when there is no fair alternative, when the alternative takes twice as long, or when there is a justified reason.
* If you prefer to drive your car, parking fees and kilometers are also reimbursable.

#### Meals 🍝

* Per diems are fully reimbursable although we usually have our meals together and the company usually pre-paid them.

#### Non-Reimbursable Purchases 🛍️

* Clothing or toiletries.
* Airline club memberships.
* Minibar purchases or bar bills.
* Laundry or dry-cleaning services.
* Parking fines or traffic violations.
* Airline ticket change fees.
