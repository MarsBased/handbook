# Digital Disconnection Policy

## 1. Purpose
At MarsBased, we care about the well-being of our team and are committed to fostering a healthy and respectful work environment. In compliance with Spanish legislation, this policy outlines the right to digital disconnection outside of working hours and adapts it to our remote and flexible organizational model.

## 2. Context
Our team works 100% remotely with flexible schedules. There is no standard schedule applied to everyone. Each person is free to organize their own working time, while ensuring they meet their individual and collective responsibilities.

## 3. Principles of the Right to Disconnect
* Everyone has the right to not respond to work-related messages, calls, or other communications outside of their working hours, even if others are working at different times.
* This right especially applies during breaks, holidays, leave, or weekends (if not part of the usual work schedule).
* Not replying outside of one's working hours will never be penalized or viewed negatively.

## 4. Best Practices
To foster a respectful and sustainable work environment:
* It is recommended to use message scheduling tools (e.g., Slack or Gmail) when working outside othersâ€™ usual hours.
* Avoid creating expectations of immediate responses outside the other person's work hours.
* Clearly inform your availability, especially if your schedule differs from the standard hours, through the appropriate channels, such as Slack and Google Calendar.
* Use Slack status updates to indicate availability, breaks, time off, or focus hours.

## 5. Exceptional Cases
Urgent communication may be justified in exceptional circumstances such as critical project issues, client emergencies, or other major unforeseen events. These situations should always be approached with good judgment and mutual respect.

## 6. Communication and Review
This policy is part of the company Handbook.
