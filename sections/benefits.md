# Benefits & Perks

Being a __MarsBased__ employee comes with a lot of benefits.

Our commitment to you is to provide you with the best tools, setup, environment and support to work.

As a MarsBased employee, you get:

* __100% remote__: Our company is conceived and prepared to be 100% remote by default. All the tools and workflows we use adapt to this philosophy.
* __Flexible hours__: Our schedule is 100% flexible so you can adapt it whenever needed. You can choose to work at the time of the day you are more productive. In our team, we have morning persons and those that prefer working during the afternoon. As long as a bunch of working hours overlaps with those of the team and client you work for, itâ€™s up to you how you organise, but let us know what times will you be working so we know when to reach out (and when not!).
* __No overtime__: You will work a maximum of 40h per week. This is a marathon, not a 100-meter sprint. We need you sane and healthy for the long ride.
* __Choose your flavour__: When you join our crew, you get a laptop with the specs you like. Given the tools we use, we recommend getting a Mac or Linux, but we're open to adapt to your preferences as much as possible.
* __Office material__: The fact that we don't have an office doesn't mean that you shouldn't have one. We will cover the costs of your office material, such as a desk, a secondary screen, a chair, etc. (use sensibly).
* __Language courses__: You will get up to USD 200 per quarter for learning languages either using iTalki, on-site lessons or online lessons with a professor you already know.
* __Paid coworking__: If working from home isn't your thing and you want to work from a coworking space, we will give you an allowance of 150 euros per month so you can choose whichever suits you best.
* __Training & learning__: We have different initiatives aimed at supporting your professional growth and skill development. From ensuring project rotation every time when possible, to the weekly Martian Tapas session, or the participation at conferences. In addition to that, we give you up to 150 euro per year for covering the cost of subscriptions, registration to courses, coaching sessions, books, etc.
* __Conferences__: We sometimes go to conferences, like FullStackFest or EuRuKo. Want to go to a conference? Ask us and we will review it to see how we can help you! Depending on the relevance for the company, you might get some days off for attending the conference, have conference tickets covered, or even get transportation and accommodation expenses covered. 
* __Sports & Health__: We want to contribute to your overall wellbeing, and that's why we're happy to offer you an allowance of 150 euros    per year to invest in sports and health-related activities or products. This can include gym fees, yoga lessons, the new running shoes you are willing to buy, a session with a personal trainer, etc.
* __Company retreat__: Once per year, we do a company off-site away from Barcelona to enjoy a few days together in a different environment.
* __Martian Days__: Every 2-3 months, we meet for a couple of days in Barcelona for a company get-together. We share the numbers of the company, strategy, interesting new projects, we conduct workshops and internal training and much more.
* __Books__: We'll buy you a few books when you start working with us so you get acquainted with how we work and what we do. If you need to purchase any other book for work, let us know!
* __Christmas dinner and other surprises__: End of the year, start of the party! Our Christmas dinners (and the subsequent parties) are legendary. We also give a few Christmas gifts and some other surprises during the year.
* __Cool swag__: Once per year, we create company swag like t-shirts, coffee mugs, hoodies or... facemasks!
* __Referral bonus__: Refer talented people to the team and you will get a bonus of 1.000 euros per hire.
