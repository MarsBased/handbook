# First day

Welcome aboard!

It is a great pleasure to welcome you to the MarsBased spaceship.

Before proceeding to your tasks, look for Leire's welcoming email in your MarsBased email inbox and read this Handbook. Both of them will help you to get set up in the company.

Make sure you've got access to the main tools: Slack, Linear, Basecamp, Harvest, Forecast, Google Drive, Google Calendar, 1Password and your email. The rest of the tools, you can find them in our [How We Work](/sections/howwework.md) section.

By now, almost everything is set & ready. If you haven‚Äôt sent us all of this, please do it:

* Twitter handle (preferably a ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù one).
* LinkedIn profile.
* Github profile.
* A picture for the website (preferably with white background).
* A couple of fun facts about you for your bio (2 lines max).

## Material

Leire has already got in touch with you in order to provide you with all the necessary material you need to start working (laptop, keyboard, trackpad, etc.). You should have received your material by now.

As part of the welcome pack, you will also receive a copy of the following books:

## Contract

You should have received the work contract for your revision from Leire a few days before your starting day. During the onboarding meeting, we will review the work contract together with you to make sure everything is clear and sign it using HelloSign.

## Onboarding

Leire will invite you to the first-day onboarding meeting on Slack. Apart from the contractual and formal part, this is the opportunity to comment on all the practical issues concerning [How We Work](/sections/howwework.md), [Our rituals](/sections/rituals.md), [Benefits & perks](/sections/benefits.md), [Requesting holidays & materials](/sections/holidaysmaterials.md), etc.

## Your project

You will then meet with our founding team and have a good chat with our COO, Jordi and our CTO, Xavi, who will explain to you how we run our projects and all the details you need to know in order to start working with the client/project assigned.

At the end of the day, you will also meet our CEO, √Älex, to wrap up the day! Take a good rest, after such an intense day!

## Your buddy

You'll be assigned an seasoned team member as a buddy in order to support you during the first months of your journey in the company. He/she will share informal knowledge related to day-to-day issues, culture, activities, etc. Your buddy will ping you throughout your first week for a first talk, and more will follow, regularly, on a weekly basis. 

## Meet the team

The first week, we will host a special [Martian coffee](/sections/rituals.md#martian-coffees) to celebrate your joining, on Friday morning, so that you get to know the rest of the team.

We are looking forward to welcoming you! üöÄ
