# First day

Welcome aboard! It is a great pleasure to welcome you to the MarsBased spaceship. Before proceeding to your tasks, this Handbook will help you to get set up in the company.

Make sure you've got access to the main tools: Slack, Basecamp, Email, Google Drive, Google Calendar, Harvest, Forecast and 1password. The rest of the tools, you can find them in our [How We Work](/howwework.md) section.

By now, almost everything is set & ready. If you haven’t sent all of this, please do it:

* Twitter handle (preferably a “professional” one)
* LinkedIn profile.
* Github username.
* A picture for the website (preferably with white background).
* A couple of fun facts about you for your bio (2 lines max).

## Material

Leire has already been in touch with you in order to provide you with all the necessary material you need to start working (laptop, keyboard, trackpad, etc.). You should have received your material by now.

## Contract

You should have received the work contract for your revision from Leire a few days before your start day. In the onboarding meeting, we will revise the work contract together with you to make sure everything is clear to proceed with the signature. Normally, we sign the contract electronically using HelloSign.

## Onboarding

Leire will invite you to the first day onboarding meeting on Slack. Apart from the contractual and formal part, this is the opportunity to comment on all the practical issues concerning [How We Work](/howwework.md), [Our rituals](/rituals.md),[Benefits & Perks](/benefits.md), [Requesting Holidays & Materials](/holidaysmaterials.md), etc.

## Your project

You will then meet with Jordi and Xavi, who will explain you how we run our projects and all the details you need to know in order to start working with the client/project assigned.

## Meet the team

The first day, we especially encourage you to join the [Martian coffee] (/rituals.md#martian-coffees) so that you get to know the rest of the team. We are looking forward to welcoming you! :-)
