Make sure you've got access to the following tools. Set up your profile, including your picture.

#### Gmail

Configure your email signature following the structure below. It can't be shown here on GitHub, but "MarsBased" goes in color `rgb(231,76,60)`. If it's easier, you can grab the example of someone else's signature from the emails you've exchanged with us.

```

#### Google Drive

You‚Äôll find all the relevant documentation such as our guidelines, procedures, and activities of the company as well as our client projects here. To name a few:

* [Time Off](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kX1bUUjUc9MJWNqbx4z5NvWUsieUL0znwmiw2MVATIo/edit?gid=0#gid=0): This is the place to visit for requesting your holidays, notifying sick leaves, etc.
* [Google Drive Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YHNPSgsB8g0jLqu0jnKVarWFom-bEEENa1-rTP5zDqs/edit#heading=h.oolhxniimdhk): What documentation do we place in Google Drive and what other do we place in Github?
* [Security Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FsCzS0RTGBO3BMzIq-hjnjKxqV6v5gHQFf7Pam4fy4Q/edit#heading=h.ly0rzhbv9kd6): Compiling good security practices to apply on yourself and your own devices.

You'll have access to the docs related to design, activities, projects, templates, etc.

#### Google Calendar

You will find the Martian activities for the year as well as important dates such as Martian anniversaries, your meetings, the retreat dates, etc.

The official timezone of the company is **CEST**.

#### Linear

Used for async communication, project management and internal one-to-many communication and reporting. Get familiar with our Linear areas:

* **MarsBased Talks:** It‚Äôs the main channel in which all the important communication with the team takes place.
* **MarsBased:** It's the place where we list internal tasks unrelated to client projects.
* **Project-specific teams:** Shared by the project members and the client. You‚Äôll be added to the teams of the projects you‚Äôll be working on.

#### Slack

Used for sync communications, and also to communicate with a few clients who want to have it. Both on Linear and Slack, we use English as our main communication language. What you need to know about the main Slack channels:

* **Status:** We use this channel to let the team know when we are working and when we are off
* **Random:** We have a random channel, shared with our freelancers, in which we discuss whatever topics we feel like. There are specific random channels as well. Feel free to join the ones you feel interested in!
* **MarsBased:** We use it for all the issues related to the company, Martian activities, etc.
* **Development:** We have a general development channel to share information and discuss development-related topics.

#### Harvest

To track your hours. This tool is used to invoice our clients. Ensure you have attributed all your hours worked at the end of each day.

#### Forecast

It's a project assignment tool that allows you to view project assignments, see who is working on each project, check the start and end dates, and see your teammates' availability.

#### 1Password

Here you‚Äôll find all the passwords and credentials you need to start working. You should be able to access the MarsBased shared vault and the vault of the specific project you‚Äôll be working on.

**Important notice:** Even though there's a "private" (now called "Employee", in the latest versions) this **is not a safe place to store your personal passwords**. Because this is a company-wide application, we could see your stuff in this section, if we wanted (we don't). To avoid this, simply set up another 1password account for your personal stuff, and it will integrate seamlessly with your existing one.

You can find the rest of the tools in the How We Work section üññ

## Guided with :heart: by Martians

Among Martians, we share the spirit of helping each other so whomever you have the chance to interact with, you'll find a colleague open to sharing experiences, learnings, and tips. There will be plenty of occasions to get to know the team, and the team to get to know you.

To start with, today, you'll be introduced and guided through your first steps on Mars by:

* **Leire/Eli** has already invited you to the first-day onboarding meeting on Slack. Apart from the contractual and formal part, this is the opportunity to comment on all the practical issues concerning [How We Work](/sections/howwework.md), [Our rituals](/sections/rituals.md), [Benefits & Perks](/sections/benefits.md), [Requesting Holidays](/sections/holidays.md), [Buddy System](/sections/buddy.md), etc.
* **Jordi and/or Xavi** will give you a general overview of how we run our projects.
* The **tech lead or the project manager** of the project you've been assigned to, will give you all the details you need to know in order to start working with the client/project. He/she will introduce you to the rest of the developers you'll be working with.
* **√Älex** will reach you for a call before you finish your first day so as to officially welcome you and clarify any questions that may have arisen during the day.

**Your buddy**, a seasoned team member that will support you during the first months of your journey in the company, will get in touch with you at some point during the week for a first talk, and more will follow, regularly, on a weekly basis. He/she will share informal knowledge related to day-to-day issues, culture, activities, etc., and will be at your disposal for any questions you may have after the big amount of information you'll receive during the first days.

The **rest of the team** is already looking forward to meeting you at our weekly team appointment, which is on Fridays at 10.30am CEST. The first week, we'll host a special Martian breakfast to celebrate your joining. Save it on your agenda! 

Meanwhile, you can feed your curious side by reading [10 facts about each Martian](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CbQSss9fiAzffojUxCZUYt9aOWddNyTSx3BoS2XhQSw/edit#heading=h.oclq2ejj0ewt).
