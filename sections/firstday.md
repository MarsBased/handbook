# First day

Welcome aboard! It is a great pleasure to welcome you to the MarsBased spaceship. Before proceeding to your tasks, this first chapter will help you to get set up in the company.

Make sure you've read the welcome PDF and that you've got access to the main tools: Slack, Basecamp, Harvest, Forecast, Google Drive, Google Calendar, 1password and your email. The rest of the tools, you can find them in our [How We Work](/howwework.md) section.

By now, almost everything is set & ready. If you haven’t sent all of this, please do it:

* Twitter handle (preferably a “professional” one)
* LinkedIn profile.
* Github username.
* A picture for the website.
* A couple of fun facts about you for your bio (2 lines max).

## Material

Leire has already been in touch with you in order to provide you with all the necessary material you need to start working (laptop, keyboard, trackpad, etc.). You should have received your material by now.

## Contract and practical issues

You should have received the work contract for your revision from Leire a few days before your start day. Together with the contract, she has sent you the invitation for the first day to do an onboarding meeting through Slack or meet presencially, if you live in Barcelona. In this meeting, you will revise the work contract together with us to make sure everything is clear to proceed with the signature.

Normally, we use HelloSign to sign the contract electronically. Apart from the formal part, this is the opportunity to comment on all the practical issues concerning How we work, Benefits & perks, Holidays & Material, Our rituals, etc.

## Your project

You will then meet with Jordi who will give you the overall picture of how we run our projects. Xavi/Jordi will then give you all the details you need to know in order to start working with the client/project assigned.

## Meet the team

The first day, we especially encourage you to join the Martian coffee so that you get to know the rest of the team. We are looking forward to welcoming you! :-)
