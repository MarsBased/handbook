# Who to ask

To make things easier, we’ve created this handy guide to help you navigate who to reach out to depending on the topic 🤓 

Remember that using the proper channels keeps things efficient, avoids confusion, and helps everyone stay aligned, especially in a fully remote company like ours:

## 🧭 People & Admin

Go to the People team for:

* Time off, sick leave & special permissions (hospitalisation, bereavement, moving, marriage, parental leave, etc.).
* Payroll, reimbursements & benefits.
* HR documents & contracts. 
* Onboarding & Offboarding.
* Company events & internal logistics.
* General policies or admin support.
* Workplace health & safety (PRL), training & medical checkups.
* Concerns related to harassment, mobbing, or workplace conflict.

## 🧰 Tools & Access

Go to Jordi for:

* Access to company tools (Slack, Linear, Harvest, etc.).
* Questions about new tools or licenses.
  
## 🚀 Project-related

Go to your Project PM or Tech Lead for:

* Clarifications on project expectations, priorities, or delivery.
* Questions about tasks, blockers, or deadlines.
* Collaboration, roles, or workload within your project team.
* Still unsure, or is no one available to help? → Reach out to Jordi.

## 💻 Technical Questions

Follow this flow to get help with technical topics:

* Start by asking the Tech Lead of your project.
* If unavailable, or if your project doesn’t have one, or simply can’t help you, reach out to another Tech Lead or Engineering Manager whose expertise fits your question:

  * Juan S. → Ruby on Rails, React, NextJS, NodeJS, Python, DevOps.
  * Pablo → Ruby on Rails, React, Remix, NodeJS, Shopify.
  * Juan A. → Ruby on Rails, React, Remix, Python, AI.
  * Carlos → React, Remix, React Native, NodeJS.
  * José Antonio → React, Remix, NextJS, NestJS, NodeJS.

* Still unsure, or is no one available to help? → Reach out to Xavi.

## 🎨 Brand & Marketing

Go to the Marketing team (Àlex & David) for:

* Content, social media, or external communication.
* Podcast, blog, newsletter, website, or YouTube channel.

## 💼 Sales & Business Development

Go to Àlex for:

* Referrals or new project leads.
* External partnerships or business opportunities.

We’re a collaborative team, and we all want to support one another. If still in doubt, ask your Buddy or the People team, and we’ll point you in the right direction 🙌
