# Open Source

MarsBased would not exist without Open Source software. The programming languages and frameworks we use are open source, and a lot of the tools we use on our daily work are open source too.

We're actively supporting, creating and maintaining Open Source projects to make software development a better place for us all.

You can find the equivalent web version of this page on our website at [MarsBased - Open Source](https://marsbased.com/open-source/).
