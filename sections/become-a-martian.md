# Become a Martian

## Join our team

We grow organically by hiring 2-3 people annually. If you wish to join our team, please visit the [Jobs page](https://marsbased.com/jobs) on our website, where we post all our job openings. If there is no suitable position, you are welcome to apply using [this form](https://marsbased.typeform.com/to/XRf2DQ). Please note that due to the high volume of applications, we may not be able to respond to every candidate. However, we **always** provide a yes or no response to all the applicants we interview.

## The hiring process

Our People team reviews all the candidate applications. They evaluate non-technical aspects of the candidature, such as the applicant's place of residence (we tend to hire more in Spain, Portugal, or other southern European countries), language skills, years of experience at each company, and cover letter.

The People team selects the candidates who best fit the open position and interviews them. This initial interview aims to get to know the applicant and assess non-technical factors. All interviews are conducted online and typically last an hour. The communication between MarsBased and the company is conducted via email. We do not make phone calls or send WhatsApp messages.

If the candidate successfully passes this interview, we will then schedule a second interview with our CTO. This technical interview lasts for two hours and enables us to learn more about the candidate's background as a software engineer or tech lead.

Finally, if the candidate succeeds in the technical interview, we schedule another video call to perform a technical test. This is not a coding exercise, but rather a discussion where we ask the software engineer how they would architect a solution to a given problem. It usually takes an hour.

## What do we value most

Some of our most important considerations when evaluating a candidate are (in no particular order):

* Strong English speaking and writing skills.
* Software engineer experience and skills matching the job requirements.
* Stable employment history without frequent job changes.
* Honest, transparent, humble, and open-minded personality that fits our team.
* Interest and enthusiasm to join our company.
* Residence in Spain, Portugal, or another southern European country.
* Experience working remotely, either from home or a coworking space.
* Reasonable salary expectations aligned with market rates and seniority.
* Punctuality and professionalism when attending interviews and responding to emails.
