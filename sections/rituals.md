# Our Rituals

Even though we're a 100%-remote company, we do a few activities both offline and online. Let's describe them!

## Martian Day

Once per term, more or less, we fly everyone in and we meet for a day of get-together.

In the Martian Days we don't do client work, and we spend quality time sharing the numbers of the company, doing AMA sessions, workshops, keynotes, brainstormings and a few leisure activities like football matches, dinners and more!

Needless to say, the company pays for the flights, meals and accommodation.

In Winter, we wrap our Martian Day with a Christmas dinner and a good party.

## Zerg Rush

In alternate months between Martian Days, we do our online hackathon called __Zerg Rush__, honouring one of our favourite games ever: Starcraft.

Typically on Fridays, we meet online at 9am to distribute tasks and work on internal projects: our product Rosetta, documentation, libraries, open source, a new website, etc.

We do another followup call at the end of the day to summarise what we've been up to and in which state are we leaving the project.

We tend to organise people in small groups with other team members they usually don't work with so they get more acquainted with one another.

Once, our frontend developer Javier Artero didn't know it was purely an online thing, so he went to the coworking for a Zerg Rush and found nobody there 🤣

## Martian Retreat

Once a year, we do a company retreat. A couple of years back, our developer Oriol came up with this great idea and we let him organise it.

The idea is to go somewhere for a couple of working days (fly in and Martian Day on Thursday, and Zerg Rush on Friday) and then the more adventurous can enjoy a weekend away, too, if they want.

So far, we've done the following:

* __2019:__ Menorca.
* __2018:__ Dublin.
* __2017:__ Tenerife.

## Basecamp check-ins

On Fridays, Basecamp will ask you a few questions. There's only one that is mandatory for everyone, which is the highlights of the week.

Reporting on how has your week been, both professionally and on a personal level, helps to overcome the feeling of loneliness of the remote worker. We have seen that those reports, and opening up about certain issues, helps to bond deeper with the rest of the team.

Some weeks, you'll share more technical stuff, while on others you will share the pictures of your holidays, notify us of a big achievement/change in your life, share a personal passion you have we didn't know about or just vent about something that you just can't keep inside any longer.

## Coworking Wednesdays

Those in Barcelona meet every Wednesdays at Spaces 22@ (C/Pallars 193, 08005, Barcelona). We've got a partnership with them to work from there once per week.

It's a great occasion to get more acquainted with people, as we go together for breakfast, lunch and occasionally for some beers at the end of the day.

## Martian Tapas

The development team meet online every Thursday to discuss tech.

You will find more information about this practice on this blog post: [Going for Martian Tapas With our Distributed Development Team](https://marsbased.com/blog/2018/12/10/martian-tapas-remote-dev-team/).

## Martian Coffees

Everyday, we open a window for casual chatter twice a day. You will see on Slack a message announcing a virtual meeting on Hangouts at 10:30am and at 3:00pm.

In this hangouts, you're always invited to join a sort of virtual water cooler for 10-15 minutes of break. If you join, signal it with an emoji reaction to the Slack message so we know there's someone in there!

## Spotify contest & English Friday

Being a small company which operates remotely for the most part means that we interact less frequently face-to-face than what most of us would like.

We try to spice up Fridays by chatting only in English and by playing our Spotify contest we describe on this blog post: [A Team Bonding Activity for Remote Teams Using Spotify](https://marsbased.com/blog/2019/04/29/team-bonding-activity-remote-teams-using-spotify/).

## Reading challenge

A few people in the company have engaged in a reading challenge. At the beginning of the year, we set a number of books we want to read and we share it on [GoodReads](https://goodreads.com).

There's no winner and no rules, just the pleasure of reading.

Have you got other ideas? A few of these were brought up by employees and now they're an integral part of our culture. Feel free to suggest good ideas!
