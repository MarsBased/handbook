# Our Rituals

Even though we're a 100%-remote company, we do a few activities both offline and online. Let's describe them!

## Martian Day

Once per term, more or less, we fly everyone in and we meet for a day of get-together.

In the Martian Days we don't do client work, and we spend quality time sharing the numbers of the company, doing AMA sessions, workshops, keynotes, brainstormings and a few leisure activities like football matches, dinners and more!

Needless to say, the company pays for the flights, meals and accommodation. If you pay for any taxi or meal, please send a photo of the receipt to administration@marsbased.com and you will get reimbursed in your next payroll, under the concept of expense allowance.  

In Winter, we wrap our Martian Day with a Christmas dinner and a good party.

## Zerg Rush

We call __Zerg Rush__ to our online hackathons, honouring one of our favourite games ever: Starcraft.

They started as a tool to force us to work on company improvements when the company had only 4-5 employees. Later on, they turned into a motivating tool by allowing us to defocus from the client projects and work with different colleagues in different things.

As of 2021, the Zerg Rushes change slightly. Every year, MarsBased defines a budget in number of days (2021 budget is 4 days), and the team is invited to make proposals on what to do with that budget. Proposals can be presented during a Martian Day or anytime during the year. They are discussed and voted (if needed) by the rest of the team members. 

Zerg Rush days can be dedicated to training sessions, pair programming, live coding, contributing to open source, developing something for the company or even attending an event. Obviously, it needs to be related to the company's activity. 

The days can be scheduled together or however the team decides. For example, one year we could schedule all the days together and do a Zerg Week, and another keep them separate and do smaller Rushes more frequently.

Proposals requiring a budget in euros ((such as flights to/fro the conference, tickets, housing, etc.) have to be discussed internally and we'll decide case by case. 

Participation is completely optional. People not wanting to participate continue working on their client projects.


## Martian Retreat

Once a year, we do a company retreat. A couple of years back, our developer Oriol came up with this great idea and we let him organise it.

The idea is to go somewhere for a couple of working days (fly in and Martian Day on Thursday, and Zerg Rush on Friday) and then the more adventurous can enjoy a weekend away, too, if they want.

So far, we've done the following:

* __2019:__ Menorca.
* __2018:__ Dublin.
* __2017:__ Tenerife.

In 2020, we had to cancel ours, as well as all of our in-person meetings and get-togethers, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Like in the Martian Day, the company pays for the flights, meals and accommodation for the two working days. For those that decide staying for the weekend, hotel expenses, transport and meals of team activities are covered as well. Again, if you pay for any taxi or meal, please send a photo of the receipt to administration@marsbased.com and you will get reimbursed in your next payroll, under the concept of expense allowance. 

## Basecamp check-ins

On Fridays, Basecamp will ask you a few questions. There's only one that is mandatory for everyone, which is the highlights of the week.

Reporting on how has your week been, both professionally and on a personal level, helps to overcome the feeling of loneliness of the remote worker. We have seen that those reports, and opening up about certain issues, helps to bond deeper with the rest of the team.

Some weeks, you'll share more technical stuff, while on others you will share the pictures of your holidays, notify us of a big achievement/change in your life, share a personal passion you have we didn't know about or just vent about something that you just can't keep inside any longer.

## Martian Tapas

The development team meets online every Thursday to discuss tech.

You will find more information about this practice on this blog post: [Going for Martian Tapas With our Distributed Development Team](https://marsbased.com/blog/2018/12/10/martian-tapas-remote-dev-team/).

## Martian Coffees

Every Friday, we open a window for casual chatter. You will see on Slack a message announcing a virtual meeting on Google Meet at 10:30am.

In this Hangouts, you're always invited to join a sort of virtual water cooler for 30 minutes of break.

If you join, signal it with an emoji reaction to the Slack message so we know there's someone in there!

## Spotify contest

Being a small company operating remotely for the most part means that we interact less frequently face-to-face than what most of us would like.

We try to spice up Fridays by playing our Spotify contest we describe on this blog post: [A Team Bonding Activity for Remote Teams Using Spotify](https://marsbased.com/blog/2019/04/29/team-bonding-activity-remote-teams-using-spotify/).

Add your song to [Martian Friday Playlist - Current Edition](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/26YmBivvzQDQ3OXa176pAl?si=wyghRlg1SLWzO9ix7ROdIQ). To avoid repeating songs, check the [Martian Friday Playlist Archive](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7CCutbZd1ojXf3X3EP8QWr?si=_2oVYBrVQq6dHA8sri5eaQ) before submitting yours!

## Reading, drawing and other challenges

A few people in the company have engaged in a reading challenge. At the beginning of the year, we set a number of books we want to read and we share it on [GoodReads](https://goodreads.com).

There's no winner and no rules, just the pleasure of reading.

Likewise, our good Pablo, spearheads a drawing contest every year with initiatives such as Inktober. Again, this is something not organised by the company and therefore not mandatory, but join us for the fun!

Last, but not list, we've got a club on Strava! If you want to join it, click here: <a href="https://www.strava.com/clubs/martians" title="MarsBased Strava" target="_blank">MarsBased Strava club</a>.

Have you got other ideas? A few of these were brought up by employees and now they're an integral part of our culture. Feel free to suggest good ideas!
