# AI tools

AI has become an integral part of the development work, revolutionizing the way we work.

By harnessing the power of AI, we can significantly enhance our efficiency as engineers and streamline our work. Whether it's getting quick answers to queries, ensuring code quality, or generating content for our development environments, AI is now seamlessly integrated into our everyday tools like GitHub, Linear, or Visual Studio Code.

We have even incorporated generative AI models into our projects to develop cutting-edge features such as human-like interactions, image recognition, text processing, and more.
As part of our AI toolkit, each engineer can decide which AI tool they prefer using and which suits their work style better. Some people prefer Raycast AI, others prefer ChatGPT, Github Copilot, Supermaven, or Cursor. The subscription to all of these services is managed by the company to ensure our code is not used to train AI models.
