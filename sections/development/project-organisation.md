Communication is vital for us, so we encourage a continuous flow of information between our team and the client to be always on the same page.

Our rituals are:

- Weekly report
- Weekly meeting with the client
- Weekly internal meeting
- Agile development rituals

## 1. <a name='Weeklyreport'></a>Weekly report

Each week, the developers fill a check-in on Basecamp with the tasks they were working on through the week, explaining their current status, estimated time left to finish each issue, and possible blockers that may arise.

The check-in has to be completed before Friday.

With all the information, the Project Manager curates a weekly report for each client.

## 2. <a name='Weeklymeetingwiththeclient'></a>Weekly meeting with the client

Once a week, the whole team gathers and runs a meeting with the client to discuss about the previous and current week's work. This way, everybody is in the loop, aware of what's the status of the project.

## 3. <a name='Weeklyinternalmeeting'></a>Weekly internal meeting

Once a week, the whole team gathers to discuss tasks for the week, blocking issues or other organizational matters concerning the whole team.

## 4. <a name='Agiledevelopmentrituals'></a>Agile development rituals

We usually use a SCRUM-based methodology with two-week sprints, but it depends on the project needs.

Using SCRUM, the Tech Lead defines before starting a sprint which tasks are included providing technical definition and estimation. Once the sprint is ready, a green light is given for developers to tackle the tasks one by one.
