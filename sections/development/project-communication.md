# Project communication

1. [Weekly report](#Weeklyreport)
2. [Weekly meeting with the client](#Weeklymeetingwiththeclient)
3. [Weekly internal meeting](#Weeklyinternalmeeting)

Communication is vital for us, so we encourage a continuous flow of information between our team and the client to be always on the same page.

Our rituals are:

- Weekly report
- Weekly meeting with the client
- Weekly internal meeting
- Agile development rituals

## 1. <a name='Weeklyreport'></a>Weekly report

Each week, Project Manager downloads the list with the tasks that the team was working on through the week, explaining their current status, estimated time left to finish each issue, and possible blockers that may arise. This list is transformed to a report, to be sent to the client.

In order to do this, every developer has to leave a daily status on each card/task he or she is working on, on Linear, so we can know the current state of the task at any given day.

## 2. <a name='Weeklymeetingwiththeclient'></a>Weekly meeting with the client

Once a week, the whole team gathers and runs a meeting with the client to discuss about the previous and current week's work. This way, everybody is in the loop, aware of what's the status of the project.

## 3. <a name='Weeklyinternalmeeting'></a>Weekly internal meeting

Once a week, the whole team gathers to discuss tasks for the week, blocking issues or other organizational matters concerning the whole team.
