Communication is vital for us, so we encourage a continuous flow of information between our team and the client to be always in the same page.

Our rituals are:

- Weekly report
- Weekly meeting with the client
- Weekly internal meeting
- Agile development rituals

### 1. <a name='Weeklyreport'></a>Weekly report

Each week, before next Monday, the developers fill a check-in with the tasks they were working on through the week, explaining its current status, estimated time left to finish each issue, and possible blockers that may arise.

With all the information, the Project Manager curates a weekly report for the client.

### 2. <a name='Weeklymeetingwiththeclient'></a>Weekly meeting with the client

Once a week, the whole team gathers and runs a meeting with the client to discuss about previous and current week's work. That way everybody is in the loop, aware of what's the status of the project.

### 3. <a name='Weeklyinternalmeeting'></a>Weekly internal meeting

Once a week, the whole team gathers to discuss tasks for the week, blocking issues or other organizational matters concerning the whole team.

### 4. <a name='Agiledevelopmentrituals'></a>Agile development rituals

We usually use a SCRUM-based methodology with two week sprints, but it depends on the project needs.

Using SCRUM, the Tech Lead defines before starting a spring which tasks are included providing technical definition and estimation. Once the sprint is ready, it starts and developers tackle the tasks one by one.
