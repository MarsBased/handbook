# How we work

## Remote

We are a remote working company. That means that we don’t have an office to work in. In fact, we have been officeless and 100% remote since the very first day and we don't plan to change this _ever_.

We will ask you to have your own space where you work from usually. A nice setup, in a comfortable environment with few distractions, works best for most of us.

Take into consideration that we do calls with our clients, so you need to have fast and reliable internet and a presentable background for the video calls.

We believe in responsibility. We are all adults. As long as work gets done, we don’t care where you do it from.

## Async first

As a remote-working company, we take async by default as common courtesy in all-remote companies dictates. We are _async-first_.

However, since we're all in similar timezones and we use Slack for a lot of things, we're friends with synchronous communication too.

The general rule is: if it's faster and it makes sense, use sync.

For things that require debate and thinking things through, we favour asynchronous communication like a good Basecamp post or a well-crafted message written on Linear over calls.

As a best practice, we all define a working schedule we will adhere to 90% of the time, so people know how can they expect us to be working, but it is not used for surveillance or micro-management. You can find each of the team members' schedules on our Slack profile.

## Open communication

Most one-on-one communication happens over Slack. In order to be all on the same page, we will ask you that you write always on public channels so information is easily accessible for everyone.

This way, we also avoid clients being too intense in private conversations.

If you want to talk about strictly private stuff, then this is a good occasion to do it privately.

## Videocalls

Despite the above, we have to communicate sometimes in synchronous mode. When scheduling a call with someone, we will prioritise having the video on to create more rapport with clients and to bond deeper with teammates.

Try to keep the calls short and on point and be respectful of everyone's time. Be on time and prepare ahead to respect the rest of the meeting participants.

## Languages

Since we've got clients from all over the globe, we use English as the only language across the company. Occasionally, some team members will choose to give a talk or training session in Spanish, but that's more the exception rather than the rule.

On the other hand, we also have clients from all over Spain, so knowing Spanish is a bonus.

We're also from Barcelona, and although Catalan is not required, it'll open more doors in certain projects where this is required (FC Barcelona, Catalan government, just to name two off the top of our heads right now).

__Things we do in English__:

* All internal communication on Slack.
* Code, PRs, tasks and documentation.
* Company-wide communications on Basecamp.
* Our Startup Grind events and conferences.
* Social media content.
* Communication with foreign clients.
* All the content on the corporate website.
* The English feed of <a href="https://podcast.marsbased.com/" title="Life on Mars" target="_blank">our podcast</a>.

__Things we do in Spanish__:

* Communication with Spanish-speaking clients.
* Most content on the website is translated into Spanish, except for the blog.
* The Spanish feed of <a href="https://podcast.marsbased.com/podcasts-es/" title="Life on Mars" target="_blank">our podcast</a>.

In the company presentations we do at the Martian Days, we speak meme.

It's also worth noting that in every Martian Day we allow for one presentation in Spanish for those less confident in their level of spoken English.

## Tools

_A grosso modo_ we use the following tools:

* __1Password__: For passwords and credentials management.
* __Google Suite__: For docs and mail and calendar, but you can use your own provided they integrate with one another!
* __Basecamp__: For project management and internal one-to-many communication and reporting.
* __Slack__: For one-to-one communication, screen-sharing and video calls, and also to communicate with a few clients who want to have it.
* __Github__: Where we store our code and we also use it to manage the tasks and the projects from a technical perspective.
* __Harvest/Forecast__: Where we track our hours and where we plan ahead. We're also using it to get reports and to invoice clients.
* __Hubspot__: We use it for certain marketing purposes and to track the dealflow and to report on sales.
* __Linear__: We use it to manage all the projects on our end. We also use it for a lot of other areas in the company like recruiting or operations.
* __HelloSign__: We use it to sign all the documents digitally (NDAs, contracts and whatnot).
