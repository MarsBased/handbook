# How We Work

## Remote

We are a remote working company. That means that we don’t have an office to work in.

We will ask you to have your own space where you work from usually. A nice setup, in a comfortable environment with few distractions, works best for most of us.

Take into consideration that we do calls with our clients, so you need to have fast and reliable internet and a presentable background for the videocalls.

We believe in responsibility. We are all adults. As long as work gets done, we don’t care where you do it from.

## Sync vs. async

As a remote-working company, we should resort to being async by default as common courtesy in all-remote companies dictates.

However, since we're all on the same timezone and we use Slack for a lot of things, we're friends with synchronous communication too.

The general rule is: if it's faster and it makes sense, use sync.

For things that require debate and thinking things through, we favour asynchronous communication like a good Basecamp post or a well-crafted message written on Slack over calls.

As a best practice, we all define a working schedule we will adhere to 90% of the time, so people know how can they expect us to be working, but it is not used for surveillance or micro-management.

## Open communication

Most one-on-one communication happens over Slack. In order to be all on the same page, we will ask you that you write always on public channels so information is easily accessible for everyone.

This way, we also avoid clients being too intense on private conversations.

If you want to talk about strictly private stuff, then this is a good occasion to do it privately.

## Videocalls

Despite the above, we have to communicate sometimes in a synchronous mode. When scheduling a call with someone, we will prioritise having the video on to create more rapport with clients and to bond deeper with teammates.

Try to keep the calls short and on point and be respectful of everyone's time.

## Languages

Since we've got clients from abroad and clients from all over Spain, we use English and Spanish almost indistinctly.

__Things we do in English__:

* Most internal communication on Slack.
* We code and document always in English with no exception.
* We post on Basecamp only in English too.
* Our Startup Grind events and conferences.
* Social media content.
* Communication with foreign clients.
* All the content on the corporate website.

__Things we do in Spanish__:

* Communication with Spanish-speaking clients.
* Most content on the website is translated into Spanish, except for the blog.

In the company presentations we do at the Martian Days, we speak meme.

## Tools

_A grosso modo_ we use the following tools:

* __1password__: For passwords and credentials management.
* __Google Suite__: For docs and mail and calendar, but you can use your own provided they integrate with one another!
* __Basecamp__: For project management and internal one-to-many communication and reporting.
* __Slack__: For one-to-one communication, screensharing and videocalls, and also to communicate with a few clients who want to have it.
* __Github__: Where we store our code and we also use it to manage the tasks and the projects from a technical perspective.
* __Harvest/Forecast__: Where we track our hours and where we plan ahead. We're also using it to get reports and to invoice clients.
* __Hubspot__: We use it for certain marketing purposes and to track the dealflow and to report on sales.
* __JIRA__: We use it to manage all the projects on our end. We also use it for a lot of other areas in the company like hiring or operations.
* __HelloSign__: We use it to sign all the documents digitally (NDAs, contracts and whatnot).
