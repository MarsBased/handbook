# How we work

## Remote

We are a remote working company. That means that we don’t have an office to work in. In fact, we have been officeless and 100% remote since the very first day and we don't plan to change this ever.

We will ask you to have your own space where you work from usually. A nice setup, in a comfortable environment with few distractions, works best for most of us.

Take into consideration that we do calls with our clients, so you need to have fast and reliable internet and a presentable background for the video calls.

We believe in responsibility. We are all adults. As long as work gets done, we don’t care where you do it from.

## Sync vs Async

The general rule is: if it's faster and it makes sense, use sync communication.

For things that require debate and thinking things through, we favour asynchronous communication, like a well-crafted message written on Linear, over calls.

As a best practice, we all define a working schedule we will adhere to 90% of the time, so people know how can they expect us to be working, but it is not used for surveillance or micro-management. You can find each of the team members' schedules on our Slack profile.

## Open communication

Most one-on-one communication happens over Slack. In order to be all on the same page, we will ask you that you write always on public channels so information is easily accessible for everyone.

This way, we also avoid clients being too intense in private conversations.

If you want to talk about strictly private stuff, then this is a good occasion to do it privately.

## Video calls

When scheduling a call with someone, we will prioritise having the video on to create more rapport with clients and to bond deeper with teammates.

While we allow using Slack huddles occasionally, the default video calling tool in the company is Google Meet.

Try to keep the calls short and on point and be respectful of everyone's time. Be on time and prepare ahead to respect the rest of the meeting participants.

## Languages

We use both Spanish and English as primary languages across the company. We write all our documentation, issues, and discussions in English. However, we accept presentations in Spanish for the Martian Days, Martian Tapas and common meetings. Both languages are used indistinguishably in our gatherings.

Knowing Spanish is not required, but it's a bonus.

## Tools

_A grosso modo_ we use the following tools:

* __1Password__: For passwords and credentials management.
* __Google Suite__: For documents, email, and calendar.
* __Google Meet__: Screen-sharing and video calls.
* __Linear__: We use it for internal one-to-many communication and reporting, and to manage all the projects on our end. We also use it for a lot of other areas in the company like recruiting or sales.
* __Slack__: For one-to-one communication, and also to communicate with a few clients who want to have it.
* __Github__: Where we store our code.
* __Harvest__: Where we track our hours. We're also using it to get reports and to invoice clients.
* __Dropbox Sign__: We use it to sign all the documents digitally (NDAs, contracts and whatnot).
* __Figma__: Our preferred design platform.
