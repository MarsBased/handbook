# The MarsBased Branding Guidelines

When using our logos and brand identity, you've got to follow a few indications that we're listing in this section of our Handbook.

# Name

First and foremost, in written form, __MarsBased__ is one word and one world only, with a capital M and a capital B. Unless required to do so, the name of the company shall not be spelled in all uppercase (MARSBASED) or all lowercase letters (marsbased).

# Logo

__Note:__ If you're reading this section using Github's dark mode, you might not see things correctly. Considering turning it off temporarily.

Our main logo is the one with the name of the company:

Sometimes, when we're forced to use a smaller logo or one with squared proportions, we use this one instead:

The small one is the one we usually include in our social profiles.

Preferably, we use the black and white logos, but we've got other options too.

On black backgrounds, you first will use the white letters logo, and if the occassion suits it, the red letters logo. For most cases, the white letters logo will do, but on our corporate templates, for instance, we use a lot of red in other elements of the documents (page number, separators, tables, etc.). If red is a prominent colour on the document, you might want to use the red versions instead.

# Margins

Consider respecting the space around the logos to let it breathe. Do not stack it right on top of other logos or next to other logos with no space between them. Here's some indications as to how much space is recommended:

And for the reduced logo:
