# The MarsBased Branding Guidelines

When using our logos and brand identity, you've got to follow a few indications that we're listing in this section of our Handbook.

# Name

First and foremost, in written form, __MarsBased__ is one word and one word only, with a capital M and a capital B. Unless required to do so, the name of the company shall not be spelt in all uppercase (MARSBASED) or all lowercase letters (marsbased).

# Logo

__Note:__ If you're reading this section using Github's dark mode, you might not see things correctly. Considering turning it off temporarily.

Our main logo is the one with the name of the company:

<img width="547" alt="Main logo" src="/assets/logo-black.png">

Over dark backgrounds, we prefer using the red version of the logo. This is the logo used on <a href="https://marsbased.com/" title="MarsBased website" target="_blank">our website</a>:

<img width="547" alt="Main logo over dark backgrounds" src="/assets/logo-red.png">

We have an alternative white version of the logo, but we don't use it very often nowadays:

<img width="547" alt="Alternative logo over dark backgrounds" src="/assets/logo-white.png">

Finally, we sometimes use green/turquoise when the red color is already highly prominent, or used by a different title, like on our <a href="https://podcast.marsbased.com/" target="_blank" title="Life on Mars">podcast website</a>:

Only use the green/turquoise logo over a #262728 background, like in this example:

<img width="547" alt="Alternative logo example" src="/assets/logo-green-example.png">

# Icon / Abbreviated

Sometimes, when we're forced to use a smaller logo or one with squared proportions, we use the following ones instead:

<img width="152" alt="Main abbreviated logo" src="/assets/logo-squared-black.png">

<img width="152" alt="Main abbreviated logo over dark backgrounds" src="/assets/logo-squared-red.png">

<img width="152" alt="Alternative abbreviated logo over dark backgrounds" src="/assets/logo-squared-white.png">

<img width="152" alt="Alternative abbreviated logo" src="/assets/logo-squared-green.png">

Follow the same color principles explained above.

# Social profile picture

In social networks, platforms, and tools, where we need to display a company profile picture, we typically use one of the following options:

<img width="152" alt="Social picture" src="/assets/logo-social-red.png">

<img width="152" alt="Alternative social picture" src="/assets/logo-social-green.png">
