# Attending conferences: what’s expected of you

When you attend a conference on behalf of MarsBased, here’s what we expect from you.

## 1) During the event

**Visibility.** Share at least one update on LinkedIn or X (Twitter) highlighting our presence (photo of the venue, keynote, booth, or yourself/team).

**Photos & videos.** Capture a few photos or short clips during the event (talks, venue, team moments) and send them to Marketing so they can edit and publish on our channels.

**Optional.** If time allows, short tweets/posts during the event are welcome.

## 2) After the event

**Write-up (internal).** Each attendee prepares a short write-up for internal use. It doesn’t need to be polished—Marketing will refine it into a blog post.  
**Suggested formats:** “Top 5 takeaways from [Event Name]” or “Top 3 talks I attended.”  
Include highlights, key insights, and any personal reflections.

**Blog post (public).** Marketing adapts your write-up into a public-facing blog post.

## 3) Why this matters

This helps us:
- Increase visibility in the community.
- Share knowledge with our audience.
- Strengthen both personal and company reputation.
