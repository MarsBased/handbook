# Permissions and security

## 1password

We use 1password as our tool of choice to manage permissions and logins to all the environments, tools and other confidential information we need for our projects.

Everyone has access to the basic logins that should be available company-wide because we organise them in vaults.

Every project has got a vault to which you will have access if you are working in that project.

We ask everyone to keep the logins tidy and up-to-date and the passwords as strong as possible. 1password can help you create strong and secure passwords. So remember that if you have signed up for a new tool or created a login that someone else might use, you should add it to the project's vault accordingly.

When you're relocated to another project, your access to the former project's vault will be revoked to avoid leaving stuff floating around.

Certain roles in the company have got more access than others. For instance, the Office Manager role has to have access to accounting tools or to all the SaaS products we use to retrieve the receipts/invoices.

## File storage and file-sharing guidelines

Here you will find our guidelines to use Google Drive, our file storage tool of choice.

### How is the main folder shared?

The MarsBased folder is no longer shared with anyone individually. Now it is shared with the entire MarsBased team through the address "team@marsbased.com". This address belongs to a Google group. Anyone added to this group has access to the folder. So, in order to add or remove someone from our MarsBased folder, we just have to edit the Google group.

### Where should we store the documents?

All the documents of the company must be stored in our Google Drive. Google Drive is our central file storage solution. After storing a file in Google Drive, a good recommended practice is to link it to the corresponding Basecamp to make it easier to access.

The folders distribution hasn't changed that much, we still have one folder for each client or project (under "Projects"); a folder where we store the document templates ("Templates"), "Sales" and "Marsketing" folders; Training, where you can find the Martian Tapas recordings; a "Design" folder with the company logos and images; "Organization", which contains mostly guides; and finally, "Martian Days", with company presentations.

### Sharing policy

This is one of the most important aspects of the new organisation.

Sharing files in Google Drive is easy but then very difficult to manage. Google Drive doesn't have an option to see which files have been shared outside the company easily. For that reason, we need to think twice before sharing something with someone, freelance, provider or client.

For security reasons, we don't want people from outside the company having access to our folders and documents.

* Never share an entire folder with someone, unless absolutely necessary. If you have to do it, for any reason, rename the folder adding (shared) at the end to make it easier to see that it has been shared outside MarsBased.
* Never share anything only with a public link, unless absolutely necessary. It's much better to share with individual people.
* If you need to share a file outside MarsBased, create a "Shared" folder and put the file in there. It will be easier to spot later on. However, don't share the entire folder, just the relevant file. The "Shared" folder is just a way to have all the shared files together.
* If the people you want to add don't need editing capabilities, make sure to add them as "viewers" or "commenters".
* If you add someone as a viewer or commenter, make sure to set an expiration date. Google Drive allows you to define expiration dates up to a year when you share a file with one of these roles. If that person needs access after the expiration date, she/he can make a request again. Sadly, editors can't have an expiration date.
* If you have doubts or questions before sharing something with someone, ask Jordi and he will clarify.

### Naming

We always add the date before a file name to be able to see when was the file created easily. We only skip the date in files that are constantly edited and therefore are always up to date, or files where the date is completely irrelevant. Some examples are a guide, a Ruby test or a template.
