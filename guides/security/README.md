# Security Guidelines

## Personal Security

Good security practices start on yourself and your own devices (laptop, mobile phone, etc.). Any device you use to do MarsBased work needs to be properly protected to minimize the chances of a bad actor accessing the device data.

## Web Application Security

It is crucial to keep the web applications we work on as secure as possible. Even the smallest vulnerability, if exploited in the right way, can be disastrous for a client. Therefore, applying good security practices to the web applications we develop for clients (and even internal applications for MarsBased) is of the utmost importance.
