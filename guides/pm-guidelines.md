# The MarsBased Project Management Guidelines

As a development consultancy, we help our clients beyond common development. We are a company of experts, and, as such, we are trusted by our clients to advise them on how to do things.

There's a myriad of ways we can help our clients. In fact, most clients praise us because we're not just excellent codes, but we also give outstanding delivery. Delivery includes communication, reporting, dealing with conflicts and setting expectations, among other nuances.

## Why are we doing this?

As a company of experts, our clients trust us to be proactive in giving them advice on how to improve their projects. What's more, we also trust you.

We cannot compete with cheaper companies who only offer standard development, because their clients only value getting code for money.

Our value proposition is to add this layer of expertise for which our clients pay this premium price. We don't just obey orders, we look for the best outcome of the project as if the project were ours.

## Examples

We should let the client know if:

* They're requesting an unreasonably big change that changes the course of the project.
* They're requesting excessive definition changes that can make the project last longer than expected.
* The client is taking a bad functional decision, even if you are not asked to give your opinion.
* They don't understand why our preferred way of deploying the application is the best for the project.
* There's a new tool/framework that can be brought into the project to bring a significant improvement in any given area.
* We spot security or legal issues with the requested functionalities.
* Etc.
