# The MarsBased Handbook 🚀

Welcome to **MarsBased**! This is the first thing you should read when boarding the **MarsBased** spaceship.

MarsBased is an all-remote development consultancy from Barcelona, building web and mobile products using Ruby on Rails, Python and JavaScript. We work at the intersection of business and technology, to help companies with their innovation projects using bleeding-edge technologies like AR/VR and AI.

Here you will find the most important information about the company to help you to get familiar with it. We also compiled some of our guides &amp; interesting stuff you should read (and some trivia & fun stories to make it more digestible).

If you're a visitor and want to use them, feel free to use them anywhere, but we'd appreciate it that you linked us back in appreciation.

We have decided to make this handbook publicly available so we can share as much as we can with other companies out there, potential candidates and prospective clients alike. Everyone is welcome!
