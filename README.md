# The MarsBased handbook

Welcome to __MarsBased__! This is the first thing you should read when boarding the __MarsBased__ spaceship.

Here you will find the most important information about the company to help you to get familiar with it. We also compiled some of our guides &amp; interesting stuff you should read (and some trivia & fun stories to make it more digestible). If you're a visitor and want to use them, feel free to use them anywhere, but we'd appreciate that you linked us back in appreciation.
